    <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <h3>Step 1</h3>

                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). </li>
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <li>Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add chicken. Cook, stirring occasionally, until no longer pink inside, 5 to 7 minutes. Add carrots, celery, bell pepper, and scallions and cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes, black beans, chili powder, cumin, garlic, onion powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper. Stir to combine. Cook until heated through, about 5 minutes more. </li>
                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <li>While mixture simmers, combine cornbread mix with milk and egg in a bowl. </li>
                    <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <li>Remove Dutch oven from heat and spread cornbread batter on top of chicken mixture to form the crust. </li>
                    <h3>Step 5</h3>
                    <li>Place Dutch oven in the preheated oven and bake until cornbread is golden and beginning to brown, 20 to 25 minutes. </li>
                </ol>
